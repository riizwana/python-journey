# 🧠 Rae's Python Playground 🐍

> From literature essays to loops and logic — this is where my pivot begins.

Welcome to my CS50P coursework vault!  
This repository holds my solutions, reflections, and experiments from [Harvard’s Introduction to Programming with Python](https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/) — a course I took to build my technical foundation as I transition from English Literature to AI/ML Engineering during my Bachelors!

## 🎯 Why I'm Doing This

I’m currently an English undergrad at QMUL, with a growing fascination for:
- 🧠 Understanding patterns in language and data
- 🤖 Building tools that think (and maybe write?) better
- 💻 Making the leap into ML engineering — one function at a time

This repo tracks that leap.

## 🗂️ What's Inside

Each file reflects a lecture, problem set, or creative spin on what I’ve learned.

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `hello.py` | My first "hello, world!" moment. Cute. |
| `grade.py` | Turns your letter grades into numbers. I swear it's nicer than it sounds. |
| `compare.py` | A file that boldly asks: are these numbers… the same? |
| `calculator.py` | Basic CLI calculator. Still no tax deduction button. |

There is more to come as I get around to more lectures.

## ✨ Coming Soon

- Lecture folders for better structure
- Short reflection notes per week
- An NLP mini-project based on Formula One probably.

## 🚀 Final Thoughts

This repo isn’t perfect — but it’s proof of process.  
I'm learning, iterating, and (occasionally) breaking things to understand how they work.  
If you’re a fellow learner, recruiter, or admissions reader: welcome. I hope you find traces of both logic and literature here.
