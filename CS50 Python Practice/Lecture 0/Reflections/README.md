# ðŸ§  Reflection â€“ Lecture 0

### ðŸ“Œ What I Learned
This week focused on functions! This would be where I have begun it all. This is what I learnt: Functions, Arguments, Side Effects, Bugs, Return Values, Variables, Comments, Pseudocode, str, Parameters, int, Operators, Interactive Mode, float, def, Scope, return.

### ðŸ˜¬ What Tripped Me Up
Reading the code for the first time really tripped me up especially when I have to learn from the lecture and got stumped on how to apply my work as I learn. I found myself being able to learn Python quicker than expected, but applied knowledge for the first time was where things got a little iffy for me.

### ðŸ’¡ How I Fixed It
I looked around on the CS50P website and they have a lot of shorts videos, problem sets and more that we were able to do in the local repository for them where I can try and test what I've leant with their checking tool (their created pytest tool) and we can see where we have gotten wrong with a simpler interface. Best thing yet? We can submit it and have them assessed.

### ðŸ§© Connection to My Pivot
This is so similar to how I would learn from my English lectures. I can absorb the knowledge but how can I apply it to make that knowledge worth it? That's why we get frequent courseworks despite the workload being immense, but with the ambition of wanting to learn it completely powers through the difficulties.

### ðŸš€ Next Steps
- My next steps is to gradually go through the problem sets without rushing. I find it best to use the pseudocode to talk to myself through what I have learnt so when coming back to it, I know where my thoughts were when making the solution to the problem set.
- Try solving a problem *before* watching the walkthrough
